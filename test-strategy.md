# Test Strategy – SAP EC, Payroll, and Kronos (Canfor Project)

This document outlines the test strategy I followed while leading testing activities for the SAP implementation at Canfor, covering SAP Employee Central, SAP Payroll, and Kronos Time & Attendance.

---

## Test Scope

- **SAP Employee Central (EC)**: Hire, job change, pay code change, leaves
- **Kronos (UKG)**: Clock in/out, absence management, overtime, shift differentials
- **SAP Payroll**: Pay processing, off-cycle payments, retro calculations, pay slip validation
- **Integrations**: EC → Kronos, Kronos → Payroll, EC → Payroll

## Test Types Performed

| Test Type            | Description                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Testing   | Verified each module's business processes work as designed         |
| Integration Testing  | Validated data flow and sync across EC, Kronos, and Payroll        |
| Regression Testing   | Ensured new changes didn't break existing functionality            |
| UAT Support          | Coordinated with business users to validate end-to-end scenarios   |

## Tools & Environment

| Tool        | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excel**   | Test case management and execution tracking  and logging |
| **Jira**    | Defect logging, triage, traceability                     |

---

## Functional Testing Focus

Validated core business processes within each system:
- Hire-to-termination workflows in SAP EC
- Leave, attendance rules and scheduling in Kronos
- Payroll run simulations and off-cycle payments in SAP Payroll

## Integration Testing Focus

Validated real-time and scheduled integrations, including:
- Employee creation in EC → replication to Payroll
- Time data entry in Kronos → passed to Payroll
- Pay code changes in EC → updated in Kronos and Payroll
- Leave requests in Kronos → validated for correct pay calculation in Payroll

## System Testing Focus

End-to-end validation within each standalone system:
- Field-level validation and UI behavior
- Error handling and boundary scenarios
- Workflow routing and approvals in EC and Kronos

---

## Out of Scope
The following areas were out of scope for my testing responsibilities:
- SAP Benefits and Compensation modules
- Finance integration
- Data migration (Handled by another team)

---

## Defect Triage & Traceability

- Held daily scrum meetings with Business users (who also acted as testers)
- Facilitated weekly defect triage with vendors and stakeholders
- Prioritized defects based on impact and severity
- Maintained full traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects

---

## Summary

The strategy focused on comprehensive coverage of high-risk business processes, with strong emphasis on **integration accuracy**, **data integrity**, and **user-centric validation** through UAT. This ensured a successful transition to the new SAP Payroll and Kronos Time & Attendance systems for 4,000+ employees.
