# Canfor SAP Test Case Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work leading functional, integration, and end-to-end testing during the SAP implementation at Canfor. I focused on three key modules:

- **SAP Employee Central (EC)**
- **SAP Payroll**
- **UKG / Kronos Time & Attendance**

This repository includes sample test cases, integration flows, and test strategies demonstrating my experience in:

- Functional testing of core HR and payroll processes
- Integration testing between EC → Kronos → Payroll
- Defect triage, UAT coordination, and data validation
